Instructions for Running Files
------------------------------

The questions are organized by folder, so to fun the files, go to a Folder (e.g. Q1) and run the code within.

Some questions are answered via Pyton files (.py) whereas some are answered in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
  > All python files can be run: $ python *.py, with the exception of Q1 which has a specific README to run
  > Jupyter Notebooks can simply be run cell by cell from top to bottom.
